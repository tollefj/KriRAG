gt;What happened - cause of death?;"The cause of death is attributed to stab wounds with extensive bleeding, but severe intoxication and possible hypothermia may also have played a role. A has explained that B grabbed a pair of scissors that were behind his back and stabbed E, who sailed over and fell to the floor. According to Doctor Mo, hypothermia likely had no significance as a cause of death, nor should a blood alcohol level of 3.1 have any bearing on the cause of death. It is the sum of stab wounds, 17 in total, that caused the bleeding to become so significant as to lead to death. Examinations have shown extensive bleeding on the outside of the dura mater in this area, and along the inside of the spinal canal; a stab channel all the way to the transverse processes of the spine, where there is abundant bleeding. E died inside the bedroom as a result of the stabs B inflicted on him. According to Doctor Mo's assessment, E may have died within 30 minutes after the stabs were inflicted. The deceased was blood-soaked on the stomach, hands, arms, face, and neck. The deceased had several visible injuries on the back and face.";partial overlap;;;;

This is supported by the fact that the stab wounds were slightly irregular and not entirely characteristic of a typical knife. A has described the scissors as quite large, with a yellow handle. Not a purple handle according to A. The scissors that were allegedly used to stab the deceased are said to have been broken into pieces and discarded by B. The police have not found scissors with a yellow handle. A pair of scissors with a purple handle has been found, on which the deceased's DNA was deposited.
